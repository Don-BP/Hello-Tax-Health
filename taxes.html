            <p>Navigating a new tax system can feel overwhelming, but don't worry. For most ALTs employed by Brain Power, the process is largely automated. Here’s what you need to know.</p>

            <h3>The Two Main Taxes You'll Pay</h3>
            <div class="doc-item">
                <h4>1. Income Tax (所得税 - Shotoku-zei)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A national tax based on your total income for the calendar year (Jan 1st - Dec 31st).</li>
                    <li><strong>How it's paid:</strong> Through a "pay-as-you-earn" system. Each month, Brain Power deducts an estimated amount directly from your salary. This is called <strong>withholding (源泉徴収 - <em>gensen-choshu</em>)</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="doc-item">
                <h4>2. Residence Tax (住民税 - Jumin-zei)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A local tax paid to your city/prefecture. It funds local services like schools, trash collection, and road maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>How it's paid:</strong> This is the part that often confuses newcomers. Residence Tax is <strong>always based on your income from the *previous* year</strong>.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Your First Year:</strong> You will not pay Residence Tax because you had no income in Japan the previous year. Enjoy the extra cash!</li>
                            <li><strong>Your Second Year Onwards:</strong> Your Residence Tax for the current year will be calculated based on the income you earned with Brain Power in the <em>prior year</em>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>How Brain Power Handles Your Tax Payments</h3>
            <div class="table-responsive-wrapper">
                <table class="styled-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Tax Type</th>
                            <th>How It's Handled by Brain Power</th>
                            <th>What You Need to Do</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Income Tax</strong></td>
                            <td>We withhold a portion from your monthly salary and pay it to the national government on your behalf.</td>
                            <td>Almost nothing! We handle the monthly payments.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>Residence Tax</strong></td>
                            <td>After your first year, your city office calculates your total Residence Tax. They send a notice to us, and we deduct it from your salary in 12 monthly installments (from June to May of the following year). This is called "special collection."</td>
                            <td>Nothing. The city communicates directly with us, and the payments are automatically deducted.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

            <h3>The Year-End Tax Adjustment (年末調整 - Nenmatsu Chosei)</h3>
            <p>This is a very important process that Brain Power handles for you, usually around November/December.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is it?</strong> The monthly Income Tax deductions are just estimates. The Year-End Tax Adjustment is a final calculation to make sure you paid the <em>exact</em> right amount of Income Tax for the year. We factor in things like your contributions to social insurance (health and pension) to reduce your taxable income.</li>
                <li><strong>What do you do?</strong> You will be asked to fill out a form confirming your details and declaring any dependents or other deductions (like life insurance payments).</li>
                <li><strong>The Result:</strong> After the adjustment, you will either get a small refund (if you overpaid) or have a small amount deducted (if you underpaid) in your December or January paycheck.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Critical Document:</strong> After this is complete, we will give you a document called a <strong>Statement of Earnings (源泉徴収票 - <em>Gensen-choshu-hyo</em>)</strong>. Keep this safe! You'll need it for visa renewals or to prove your income.</li>
            </ul>
