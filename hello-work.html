            <p>This guide is for those whose time with Brain Power is ending and who plan to stay in Japan to look for a new job. It explains the financial support system available to you.</p>

            <h3>What is Hello Work (ハローワーク)?</h3>
            <p>Hello Work is the Japanese government's employment service center. It has two main functions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A Job Center:</strong> They help people find new employment.</li>
                <li><strong>An Insurance Office:</strong> They administer <strong>Unemployment Insurance (雇用保険 - <em>koyou hoken</em>)</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="highlight"><strong>Important:</strong> Applying for and managing these benefits is your personal responsibility. While we provide the necessary paperwork, you must complete the process yourself.</p>

            <h3>Am I Eligible for Unemployment Benefits?</h3>
            <p>To receive benefits, you must meet all the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Have a Valid Work Visa:</strong> You must hold a residence status that permits you to work (e.g., Instructor, Specialist in Humanities). You cannot receive benefits if your visa has expired.</li>
                <li><strong>Have Paid into the System:</strong> You must have been enrolled in Unemployment Insurance for at least <strong>12 months within the last 2 years</strong>. (This rule has a critical exception for contract non-renewal, explained below).</li>
                <li><strong>Be Actively Seeking Work:</strong> You must be willing, able, and actively trying to find a new job in Japan. You cannot receive benefits if you are not looking for work or plan to leave the country.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="clarification-box">
                <h3>Important: For Contracts Shorter Than One Year (e.g., May to January)</h3>
                <p>The standard "12-month" rule often causes confusion for ALTs on shorter contracts. Here is the solution.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> A 9-month contract does not meet the 12-month requirement. A Hello Work officer might initially deny your claim.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Solution: The "Involuntary Separation" Exception.</strong> The insurance requirement is lowered to <strong>6 full months</strong> in the last year if you left for an "involuntary" or "justifiable" reason.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crucially, having your fixed-term contract end and not be renewed is considered an involuntary separation.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What You Must Do at Hello Work:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brain Power will ensure your <strong>Letter of Separation (離職票 - <em>Rishoku-hyo</em>)</strong> is correctly marked as <strong>"Contract Period Expired" (契約期間満了 - <em>keiyaku kikan manryō</em>)</strong>. This is our promise to you.</li>
                    <li>When you apply, a staff member may still question your eligibility. This is your moment to clarify.</li>
                    <li>Politely point to your <em>Rishoku-hyo</em> and use this simple Japanese phrase:
                        <p class="japanese-phrase">「契約期間満了による離職です。」<br><em>(Keiyaku kikan manryō ni yoru rishoku desu.)</em><br>"My employment ended due to the completion of my contract period."</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h3>The Step-by-Step Process to Receive Benefits</h3>
            <div class="doc-item">
                <h4>Step 1: Gather Your Documents</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Letter of Separation (離職票 - Rishoku-hyo)</strong>: We will send this to you after your contract ends. This is essential.</li>
                    <li><strong>My Number Card</strong> (or notification card)</li>
                    <li><strong>Residence Card (Zairyu Card)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Bank Book or Cash Card</strong> (for an account in your name)</li>
                    <li><strong>Two passport-sized photos</strong> (3.0cm tall x 2.4cm wide)</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal seal (inkan/hanko)</strong> (if you have one)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
             <div class="doc-item">
                <h4>Step 2: Apply and Follow the Process</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Go to Your Local Hello Work Office:</strong> Find the office that has jurisdiction over your registered address.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply and Register:</strong> Submit your documents. They will give you a handbook and dates for your mandatory seminar and first Recognition Day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve the 7-Day Waiting Period (待機期間 - <em>Taiki-kikan</em>):</strong> This is a standard, unpaid waiting period for everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attend Recognition Days (認定日 - <em>Nintei-bi</em>):</strong> Every 4 weeks, you must go to Hello Work to submit a form showing your job-seeking activities.
                        <span class="info-trigger" data-info="You must perform at least TWO valid job-seeking activities every 4 weeks. Examples: 1) A consultation with a Hello Work staff member. 2) Applying for a job. 3) Attending a job fair. Simply browsing job boards at home is not enough.">What counts as a job-seeking activity?</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>You must repeat this cycle for as long as you claim benefits. Report ALL part-time work, as failure to do so is considered fraud.</p>
