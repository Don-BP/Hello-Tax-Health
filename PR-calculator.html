        <p>
          Estimate your eligibility for accelerated Permanent Residency (PR) in Japan using this calculator.
          It's based on the official <strong>Highly Skilled Professional (HSP) point system</strong>, which is one way to potentially shorten the required residency time.
          While this system applies to ALTs, reaching the 70 or 80 point thresholds can be challenging, often due to salary levels.
          Use this tool to understand your current standing and identify potential areas for improvement.

             <h3>Guidance for ALTs on Reaching HSP Point Thresholds</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Why Your Score Might Be Below 70:</strong> The most common reason for ALTs is the <strong>Annual Salary</strong> category. Many bonus points (Research, Management, etc.) are also not applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>How ALTs CAN Gain Points:</strong> Focus on what you can control. <strong>JLPT N1</strong> (+15 pts) is often the most impactful goal. Long-term <strong>Professional Experience</strong> (+20 pts for 10+ years) and a <strong>Master's/PhD</strong> are also key. A higher salary is the most direct path.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Reaching 70/80 points often requires a combination of factors, such as a Master's degree, 7+ years of experience, a salary over ¥6M, and JLPT N1.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Path:</strong> Remember, the standard path to PR (typically after 10 years of continuous residency) is still available even if you do not meet HSP criteria.</li>
            </ul>
